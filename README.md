# Simulation of an eco-evolutionary model


## About
This project contain the simulation I used during my Scientific Initiation, done at the [Biophysics Group](http://fig.if.usp.br/%7Ebiofisic/estudantes_en.html) of the Departamento de Física Geral, part of the [Instituto de Física](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/en/welcome-ifusp) of the Universidade de São Paulo. This was part of a project together with Profa. Dr. Carla Goldman, Dhyan V. H. Kuraoka and Pedro Ribeiro de Almeida, funded by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil under Grant No. 2015/17395-3.


## The sitution modeled
This work simulates two competing strains of the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. One produces the *invertase* needed for the hydrolysis of sucrose and the other don't, just getting the beneficial of the this public good. We modeled this using Evolutionary Game Theory coupled with ecological models in order to explain the interesting and complex behavior that emerges from already done experiments.
